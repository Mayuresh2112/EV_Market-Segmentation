# EV_Market-Segmentation

Feynn Labs was in charge of this project. Internship Before we begin a marketing strategy, we must first conduct a segmentation analysis. As a result, learning how to analyse our audience and market is critical After conducting market research are the most. With that, I've completed my internship at Feynn Labs as a Machine Learning intern. I'd want to express my gratitude to Mr. Sanjay Basumatary for this fantastic chance.
